# A/B Testing Result Analysis on Total Conversion

**An international e-commerce company has completed A / B testing of a new interface for an improved recommendation system for EU-based users.**

The expected output was:
the increase in the total conversion of users from the EU at each stage of the `product_page → product_card → purchase` funnel must be at least 10%.

This repository is an attempt to answer what really happened.

The analytical task to study the results of A / B testing, the dataset and test results files used in this project are dummy. The project was created exclusively for practice.
